# Scramble OLED + Encoder Keymap
A Nullbits Scramble macropad QMK keymap for the OLED + Rotary Encoder configuration.

Includes an OLED animation I made from a vector graphic following some online tutorials.

Rotary encoder is mapped to control volume, but could be ported to VIAL if anybody wants to do that.
